### Hi everyone! My name is Myah Savage 👋🏽

### My Focus 🔍
My primary focus is front-end development! My projects (linked below) have been reflections of my own interest and passions. With each, I maintain sleek modern designs to maintain a sense of ease throughout the user experience utlizing my creative lens. No matter how complex the applications, they will always be cohesive and user friendly.

### My Background 👣
I graduated from a 2 year community college with an AA degree in Business/Commerce General. I broke into the tech industry originally being a Sales Development Representative for a IT company. However, I didn't feel fullfilled with my work because it was redundant and I don't like to be complacent in any area of my life. It wasn't until I signed up for SheCodes that I discovered I loved to code and that coding was actually fun. I love that my brain is stimulated daily with new problems to solve. I will never be stagnent in this field, instead there will be constant growth and like-minded idividuals surrounding me.
